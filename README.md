> **Turn your linear Claude Code CLI into a macro-planning Node Graph.**

ClawUI transforms Claude Code from a simple chat interface into an autonomous project manager. It visualizes complex tasks as a **Blueprint DAG**, executes them node-by-node with full context isolation, and **reuses sessions and artifacts** across the graph — solving context window explosion and terminal scroll fatigue while dramatically improving token efficiency.

## ✨ Why ClawUI?

* **🗺️ From Terminal to DAG:** Visualize macro-plans as a node graph. Let Claude plan the architecture, and execute it node-by-node.
* **♻️ Session Reuse, Not Session Waste:** In typical Claude Code workflows, sessions are fire-and-forget — all that context and token spend is lost. ClawUI **resumes** sessions on retry, **passes AI-distilled handoff artifacts** (not raw logs) to downstream nodes, and **keeps every session indexed and searchable**. The result: higher token efficiency, lower costs, and a compounding knowledge base.
* **⚡ Proactive Copilot:** When a session pauses, AI proposes the top 3 next actions as one-click buttons — no typing required.
* **🔒 100% Local & Secure:** Runs on top of your local `~/.claude/` directory. No external cloud relays, no code leaving your machine.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1. AI-Powered Planning — From Idea to DAG

![Planning Flow](docs/images/planning-flow.svg)

* **Smart Task Creation** — Describe a goal (e.g., *"add OAuth login"*). Claude analyzes your codebase and generates implementation-ready nodes with file paths and acceptance criteria, grounded in real code.
* **Smart Dependency Selection** — AI auto-wires dependency edges between nodes. Re-run analysis on any node with one click.
* **Smart Task Decomposition** — Split oversized nodes into 2-3 sub-nodes. Downstream edges are automatically rewired.

### 2. Autonomous Execution — Self-Healing Task Graph

![Execution Flow](docs/images/execution-flow.svg)

* **Grounded Execution Context** — Each node gets its own Claude Code session with AI-distilled handoff artifacts from upstream dependencies — concise context in a fraction of the tokens a full replay would cost.
* **Post-Completion Evaluation** — AI evaluates each completed node: **COMPLETE** (continue), **NEEDS_REFINEMENT** (insert follow-up), or **HAS_BLOCKER** (create blocker sibling). The graph mutates itself at runtime.
* **Smart Retry & Session Resume** — Failed nodes resume the *same* session with a lightweight continuation prompt. Zero wasted tokens re-explaining the task.
* **Run All** — One click queues all eligible nodes in dependency order. Failures pause the graph for human review.

### 3. Session Timeline — Full Observability

Every Claude Code interaction is captured as a rich, interactive timeline with structured I/O views, proactive suggestion buttons, and full session management (star, tag, search, filter).

## 🛠 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js 20+** and **npm 10+**
* **Claude Code CLI** installed globally (or another supported agent — see [Multi-Agent Support](#-multi-agent-support))
* **macOS, Linux, or Windows** — `expect` is only required for the Claude Code runtime on macOS/Linux (TTY wrapping). Other agent runtimes (Codex, OpenClaw, Pi) work on all platforms without `expect`. On Windows, Claude Code uses direct `CLAUDE_CLI_JS` node invocation instead.

### Option A: Install via npm (recommended)

```bash
# Run directly (installs on first run, then starts)
npx @clawui/cli

# Or install globally for repeated use
npm install -g @clawui/cli
claw-ui
```

**Custom ports:** `PORT=4001 FRONTEND_PORT=4000 npx @clawui/cli`

### Option B: Clone from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ccchow/ClawUI.git
cd ClawUI
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the secure URL (with auth token) printed in the terminal.

### Before You Start: Configure Your Claude Code Environment

**Before creating your first Blueprint**, configure these for best results:

* **`CLAUDE.md`** — Run `/init` in Claude Code to generate one. Every node execution reads it automatically for persistent project context.
* **MCP Servers** — Connect external tools (Playwright, databases, etc.) via [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). Node prompts auto-hint available tools.
* **Skills & Plugins** — Nodes inherit all skills/plugins from your `~/.claude/` directory. **Strongly recommended:**

  ```bash
  /plugin install claude-md-management@claude-plugins-official
  ```

A well-configured environment = higher-quality nodes + fewer retries = significant token savings.

## Security

* **Localhost-only** — Both backend (:3001) and frontend (:3000) bind to `127.0.0.1`. Remote access via [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/): `tailscale serve --bg 3000`.
* **Auth token** — Random token generated on each startup, required on all `/api/*` requests. CORS locked to `127.0.0.1:3000`.
* **`--dangerously-skip-permissions`** — Required by Claude Code for programmatic use. ClawUI passes it automatically; this is a Claude Code requirement, not a ClawUI design choice.

## 🔌 Multi-Agent Support

ClawUI supports multiple AI agent backends — switch at startup via the `AGENT_TYPE` environment variable:

| Agent | `AGENT_TYPE` | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `claude` (default) | Anthropic's official CLI |
| **OpenClaw** | `openclaw` | Open-source Claude Code fork with custom model providers |
| **Pi Mono** | `pi` | Lightweight coding agent |
| **Codex CLI** | `codex` | OpenAI's Codex CLI agent |

```bash
AGENT_TYPE=openclaw npm run dev
```

All blueprint operations (generation, execution, evaluation, enrichment) route through the selected agent runtime.

**Agent-specific environment variables:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `OPENCLAW_PATH` | Custom path to the OpenClaw CLI binary (auto-detected if not set) |
| `CODEX_PATH` | Custom path to the Codex CLI binary (auto-detected if not set) |
| `PI_PATH` | Custom path to the Pi Mono CLI binary (auto-detected if not set) |
| `OPENCLAW_PROFILE` | OpenClaw Docker instance profile name — adds `--profile <name>` to CLI invocations and scans `~/.openclaw/openclaw-<name>/agents/` for Docker sessions |

## 🎭 Role System

Blueprints support a **multi-role mechanism** that tailors execution prompts and evaluation criteria per node:

| Role | Color | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| **SDE** (Software Developer) | Blue | Implementation, code quality, architecture |
| **QA** (Quality Assurance) | Green | Testing, validation, edge cases |
| **PM** (Product Manager) | Purple | Requirements, acceptance criteria, user stories |

* **Blueprint-level defaults** — Set `enabledRoles` and `defaultRole` on a blueprint. All nodes inherit the default unless overridden.
* **Node-level override** — Assign specific roles to individual nodes (e.g., a testing node gets QA, a spec node gets PM).
* **Role-aware prompt assembly** — Each role contributes specialized system instructions, execution context, and artifact format expectations.
* **UI components** — `RoleBadge` displays the role with its color; `RoleSelector` lets you pick roles during node editing.

## 🔍 Blueprint Insights

The **insight system** provides automated intelligence about blueprint execution:

* **Automatic generation** — Insights are generated during node execution when the agent detects cross-cutting concerns, dependency issues, or optimization opportunities.
* **Severity levels** — `info` (blue), `warning` (amber), `critical` (red) — each with distinct visual treatment.
* **NavBar badge** — An unread count dot appears on the Blueprints nav link when new insights arrive.
* **Actions** — Mark insights as read or dismiss them. Optimistic UI updates keep the experience snappy.
* **Plan Coordinator** — Reads unread insights and can suggest blueprint graph changes (adding nodes, rewiring dependencies) based on the intelligence gathered.

## 🪟 Windows Support

ClawUI runs on Windows with a few platform-specific notes:

* **No `expect` requirement** — Windows uses direct node invocation for Claude Code and `execFile` for other agent runtimes. No TTY wrapping needed.
* **CRLF line endings** — `.gitattributes` enforces `eol=lf` for all source files. Windows tools may write CRLF, causing `git add` to fail. Convert with `sed -i 's/\r$//'` before staging.
* **Drive letter handling** — Path encoding handles Windows drive letter colons (`C:`) correctly across all agent runtimes.
* **CI coverage** — The CI pipeline runs on both Ubuntu and Windows (Node.js 20 + 22).

## 🔮 Coming Soon
